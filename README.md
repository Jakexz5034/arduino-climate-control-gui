# arduino-climate-control-gui
MATLAB App Designer + Arduino “smart room” controller. Reads temperature (NTC) and light (photoresistor), displays gauges, and controls a servo-driven window plus two LEDs. Manual mode lets users set window/LEDs and light intensity; automatic mode adjusts lighting/window. Logs temperature to timestamped files and plots saved data.
